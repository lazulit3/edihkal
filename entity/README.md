# `entity`

Entity models for edihkal generated using [`sea-orm-cli`](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/docs/generate-entity/sea-orm-cli/).

The top-level module files (e.g. `src/drugs.rs`) contain generated code (with a few currently unavoidable adjustments).
The `behavior` module contains additional human-managed code that is not generated by [`sea-orm`](https://crates.io/crates/sea-orm).

## Understanding `sea-orm`'s Derive Macros & Structure

`sea-orm-cli`'s default behavior is to generate entity code using `--compact-format` (as opposed to the [expanded format](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/docs/generate-entity/expanded-entity-structure/)).
This uses derive macros for most of the heavy lifting.

When trying to understand exactly what you're working with, it may be helpful to view the expansion of the macros using [`cargo-expand`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-expand).
For example: `cargo expand drug` to expand `src/drug.rs`
