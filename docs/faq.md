# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is edihkal ready to use?

**Warning:** Edihkal is in early stages of development (pursuing a proof of concept). It is not ready to use, so please do not trust it with your data.

## Why is edihkal named "edihkal"?

Edihkal is an acronym that expands to "**E**very **D**rug **I** **H**ave **K**nown **a**nd **L**oved", but is officially stylized as "edihkal" (lowercase is more pleasant to type).

Edihkal's name is a faithful nod to some of [Sasha Shulgin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) more famous works:

* PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved)
* TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved)

Edihkal is [not the first](https://buttplug-spec.docs.buttplug.io/docs/stpihkal) FOSS project to have known and loved, and certainly won't be the last.

## I don't do drugs.

Edihkal uses the term "drug" loosely. In this context, it's likely that you do use drugs. See ["What is a drug?"](#what-is-a-drug) below.

## What is a drug?

Edihkal's notion of a "drug" refers to a much looser definition than most, referring to a working definition used in Sasha Shulgin's lectures. Shulgin's definition of drugs includes, "those things that influence a living organism or behavior", and in different words, "a drug is something that modifies the expected state of a living thing.") (See Lecture 1 from Shulgin's The Nature of Drugs.) (TODO: Citations)

More generally, edihkal is a project exploring whether software tools can help us:
* record data about some specific things in our lives
* gain insights about *how* these things affect our lives

Edihkal calls these things "drugs".

### What are some examples of drugs in the context of edihkal?

Some examples of what a "drug" in edihkal could include:

| Example of a Drug | Notes*
| ----------------- | ----
| Cocaine | An illicit (illegal), recreational, stimulant drug.
| Alcohol | A legal, recreational, depressant drug. (Though we may have cultural tendencies to think of legal drugs as being different from "drugs", alcohol is a drug nonetheless).
| Caffeine | A legal stimulant drug often enjoyed in the morning (and one of the most widely used drugs in the world).
| Ketamine | A disassociative drug that may be legal in the context of accepted medical uses (e.g. as an analgesic or as an anti-depressant) or illegal when used recreationally.
| Light | Even bright light can be a drug. Consider [light therapy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy) application towards treating Seasonal Affective Disorder.
| Music | Music can have powerful effects on mind and emotions. (Subjectively, it sure as hell feels like a drug!)

*\* A drug's legal status varies from place to place; these notes discuss legality from a limited perspective for the sake of example. (The point is that the scope of "drugs" extends well beyond illicit substances.)*
