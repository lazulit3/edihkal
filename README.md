[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but far from ready to use.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

> **Warning:** Edihkal is in early stages of development (pursuing a proof of concept). It is not ready to use, so please do not trust it with your data.

Edihkal is a tool that helps data-minded (drug) users record histories of and reflect on drug use.

This project is currently in an exploratory phase pursuing a **Proof of Concept** (PoC). Most planned features are not yet implemented (or even documented) and plans are fast & loose.

This README is sparse right now (sorry!), but if you have questions you can check out edihkal's [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/faq.md) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/lazulit3/edihkal/discussions/new?category=q-a) (if you don't find your answer there).

## Local Development

For notes on setting up a local development environment running the `edihkal` API service, see [`edihkal/localdev/`](edihkal/localdev).
